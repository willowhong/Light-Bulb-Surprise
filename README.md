# Light-Bulb-Surprise
An arduino project that turns a light bulb into a confetti globe!

# Hardware setup
You will need: 
1. Arduino
2. An opened light bulb. See tutorial here: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-open-a-light-bulb-without-breaking-it/
3. A big push button like this one: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9181
4. A motor, and washers/screwers suitable for that motor: https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1364.html?gclid=Cj0KCQiAh_DTBRCTARIsABlT9MbmSx1uAZmb9qWE8bFKnP7xlz5WyiUIDODyzbtykt2SeEkngHuiDIYaAijgEALw_wcB
5. A potentiometer like this one: https://www.adafruit.com/product/562?gclid=Cj0KCQiAh_DTBRCTARIsABlT9MZuYtNu8MGUa9ZaUPiwVqI1V_8Gbmpv8nNJv5ZI1noHwkUShHjmKGcaAoidEALw_wcB
6. Two boxes, one for staging the button, one for staging the light bulb. Their lasercut files(dxf) are in the repository.
7. Some colorful beads!

# How to play
When you push the button, the arduino will tell the motor and its attached washer to spin. So instead of expecting for the bulb to be lighten up, you actually see many colorful beads bouncing around inside of the light bulb. What a surprise!
